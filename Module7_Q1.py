# 1. Write a program to print and insert the value of tau in an available field width space of 8 characters (center aligned), 
# also print and insert the value of Â½ tau to determine the value and insert / center align as shown in the first console example below). 
# Console:
# The value of Tau is {}, which is two times {}.

# Example:
# The atomic number of Helium is    2     , which is twice the atomic number of 
# Hydrogen, which has a value of    1    .

from math import tau, pi
